Coding Questions

(Move Zeroes)
Q. Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array

=> Solution:


def movesZeroes(nums, n):
	count = 0
	for i in range(n):
		if nums[i] != 0 :
			nums[count] = nums[i]
			count += 1
	while count < n:
		nums[count] = 0
		count += 1

nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
n = len(nums)
movesZeroes(nums,n)
print(nums)


(First Unique Character in a String)
Q.  Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.
   
=> Solution:
  
  
def firstUniqueCharacter(s):
	for c in s:
		if s.index(c) == s.rindex(c):
        		return s.index(c)

s = "loveleetcode"
print(firstUniqueCharacter(s))
